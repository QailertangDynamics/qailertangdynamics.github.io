<p>This is an era of man to the power of machine: not man versus machine, but man and machine. In addition to technological change, this new age requires us to change how we do our work.</p>
<p>Helping the future arrive is what we do. We solve the great problems of our times. we create innovative technologies that define eras, while no one knows what’s going to change the world next, we’re probably already working on it.</p>
<p>We began as a spin off from the North Amarok Technology Academy, where we developed the first animal-like mechanoids. Now we are taking the next step, combining the principles of dynamic control and balance with sophisticated mechanical designs, cutting edge electronics, and software for perception, navigation and intelligence. Qualiertang Dynamics has an extraordinary technical team of engineers and scientists who seamlessly combine advanced analytical thinking with bold engineering.</p>
<p>We pride ourselves in building machines that both break boundaries and work in the real world.</p>

<h2><a id="SERIES_ORIONIS__Military_Grade_Mechanoids_27"></a>SERIES ORIONIS™ - Military Grade Mechanoids</h2>
<p>Designed for private military, political and civilian high-profile customers that want a personal highly efficient bodyguard, Orionis™ units are built with extra exoeskeletal shielding and weapon mounts and has three times more sensors than any other units, to respond immediately to any danger posed to the person or property it is assigned to.</p>
<h3><a id="ORIONIS_Models_available_31"></a>ORIONIS™ Models available</h3>
<h4><a id="Alpha_Model__Betelgeuse_Male_32"></a>Alpha Model - Betelgeuse™ (Male)</h4>
<p>Increased armor specs, 120lbs heavier. Supports Heavy artillery mounts. Recommended for diplomats or politicians in conflict zones or in international events.</p>
<h4><a id="Beta_Model__Rigel_Female_34"></a>Beta Model - Rigel™ (Female)</h4>
<p>Lightweight materials, more discrete armor, wider sensor array range. Recommended for civilians and for users that wan’t a “less agressive” presentation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Orionis™ models aren’t meant to be used actively as combat units, performance benchmarks and durability does not apply to these conditions.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h2><a id="SERIES_PISCIS_AUSTRINUS__Industry_Grade_Mechanoids_40"></a>SERIES PISCIS AUSTRINUS™ - Industry Grade Mechanoids</h2>
<p>Designed for utility in industrial environments, Piscis Austrinus™ units can serve as an all-in-one worker, being able to be customised depending on the segment. These units offer the high efficiency of industrial machinery, with the mobility and self-thinking capacities of a human being.</p>
<h3><a id="PISCIS_AUSTRINUS_Models_available_44"></a>PISCIS AUSTRINUS™ Models available</h3>
<h4><a id="Alpha_Model__Fomalhaut_Male_45"></a>Alpha Model - Fomalhaut™ (Male)</h4>
<p>Heavy multipurpose arm mount to accommodate several specialised tools. Recommended to large-scale industry like cars and planes production lines.</p>
<h4><a id="Beta_Model__Samaka_Female_47"></a>Beta Model - Samaka™ (Female)</h4>
<p>Instrument-agnostic arm mount capable of adapt itself to multiple kinds of use in a short timeframe. Dozens of tiny interlocked puzzle-like structure rearrange themselves to make the most fitting tool structure to be used. Recommended to product and “handcraft” industries that require multiple specialised machinery.</p>
<h2><a id="SERIES_LEONIS__Enterprise_Grade_Mechanoids_51"></a>SERIES LEONIS™ - Enterprise Grade Mechanoids</h2>
<p>Designed for corporate environments, Leonis™ units bear no armor at all, except for their already highly resistant  graphene exoskeleton. They’re built entirely on computing power, Leonis™ models process hundreds of thousands of finantial and publicly-available data to produce, and discuss strategy options as if it was one of your executives.</p>
<h3><a id="LEONIS_Models_availables_55"></a>LEONIS™ Models availables</h3>
<h4><a id="Alpha_Model__Regulus_Female_56"></a>Alpha Model - Regulus™ (Female)</h4>
<p>Conservative strategy tracer, calculations are slightly biased to favor maximum profit for the least risk possible. Recommended for startups and corporations that want a discrete and safe-play advisor.</p>
<h4><a id="Beta_Model__Denbola_Female_58"></a>Beta Model - Denëbola™ (Female)</h4>
<p>Agressive strategy tracer, calculations are slightly biased to predict and exploit opportunities, this model takes advantage of market uncertainty and traces exotic strategy branches as well as presenting their respective caveats. Recommended for market veterans and strongly firmed corporations that can sustain some degree of risk.</p>
<h2><a id="SERIES_CANIS__Luxury_Grade_Mechanoids_62"></a>SERIES CANIS™ - Luxury Grade Mechanoids</h2>
<p>Desined solely for novelty and display, the Canis™ models are for those that doesn’t need a special reason to own of our units, they just want one to serve them. Canis™ units are built with experimental noise-matrix personality modules, what makes their personality unpredictable and more colorful. They’re the edge of the edge, your tech playground, the latest updates reach these models before any other. Synthetic skin is used to coat most of the model, leaving just some small strips of graphene-enclosed parts where sensitive instruments are located.</p>
<p>Canis™ units are made to look beautiful and feel fancy.</p>
<p>The default outfit for these units is the classic Meridian Housekeeper Attire, customers can request custom outfits contacting our sales representatives.</p>
<h3><a id="CANIS_Models_availables_70"></a>CANIS™ Models availables</h3>
<h4><a id="Alpha_Model__Procyon_Male_72"></a>Alpha Model - Procyon™ (Male)</h4>
<p>Conversational bias into passive-voiced interaction. This model usually receives updates later than other models, as they are deemed more stable and polished. Recommended to users that want a more contained and discrete figure in their homes.</p>
<h4><a id="Beta_Model__Gomeisa_Female_74"></a>Beta Model - Gomeisa™ (Female)</h4>
<p><s>No conversational bias installed, tends to be more active-voice on its interactions. Experimental self-awareness module included for maximum humanlike interaction.</s></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>(Notice: GOMEISA™ Model was discontinued due to delays in the development, and was replaced by the respective B model from SERIES GEMINIS™ units.)</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h4><a id="Gamma_Model__Pollux_Female_79"></a>Gamma Model - Pollux™ (Female)</h4>
<p>This model brings a lot of experimental features developed for the SERIES GEMINIS™. This is the first model to receive the Unified Memory Matrix® that can exchange information with all copies of this unit. The Geminis™ units were designed for the younger public, with a strong and unpreprogrammed personality that would be shaped from all the interactions it gets along the way.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>CANIS™ Gamma Model can also be interchangeably be used with LEONIS™ and PISCIS AUSTRINUS™ units.</p>

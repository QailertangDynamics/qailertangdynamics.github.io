###A constant state of innovation: Engineering a better tomorrow

This is an era of man to the power of machine: not man versus machine, but man and machine. In addition to technological change, this new age requires us to change how we do our work.

Helping the future arrive is what we do. We solve the great problems of our times. we create innovative technologies that define eras, while no one knows what's going to change the world next, we're probably already working on it.

We began as a spin off from the North Amarok Technology Academy, where we developed the first animal-like mechanoids. Now we are taking the next step, combining the principles of dynamic control and balance with sophisticated mechanical designs, cutting edge electronics, and software for perception, navigation and intelligence. Qualiertang Dynamics has an extraordinary technical team of engineers and scientists who seamlessly combine advanced analytical thinking with bold engineering.

We pride ourselves in building machines that both break boundaries and work in the real world.
